- Truffle: 
    It is a Development Environment, Testing Framework and Asset pipeline for Ethereum Blokchains. Ganache : Ganache is a personal Ethereum Blockchain used to test smart contracts where you can deploy contracts, develop applications, run tests and perform other tasks without any cost.
    
- Infura:
    provides the tools and infrastructure that allow developers to easily take their blockchain application from testing to scaled deployment - with simple, reliable access to Ethereum and IPFS.
    
- OpenZeppelin Contracts:
     helps you minimize risk by using battle-tested libraries of smart contracts for Ethereum and other blockchains. It includes the most used implementations of ERC standards.
     
- metamask:
      is a free web and mobile crypto wallet that allows users to store and swap cryptocurrencies, interact with the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, and host a growing array of decentralized applications (dApps). It is one of the most widely used crypto applications in the world.
